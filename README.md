**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

### Project Scope: 

This was a `Time-Crunch Sprint` challenge where I built out a simple `budget app` that allows you to set a budget and then add expenses. This was a `mobile build` that utilized `vanilla JavaScript`, `HTML`, and the `Bootstrap Framework`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project was part of a sprint challenge series that focused on functionality first, meeting the client's requirements, and supplying a working product prior to the time-crunched deadline. **There is opportunity to improve the UI & UX design and responsiveness, if desired.**

- [x] Add or Delete expenses
- [x] Update amounts accordingly
- [x] Track totals
